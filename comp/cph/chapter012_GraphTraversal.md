Chapter 12: Graph traversal
===
 * DFS and BFS are super important to basic questions (LC)

Depth-first search
---
 * O(m+n), m = edges, n = nodes
 * Goes as deep as possible first (depth)
 * Uses stack

Breadth-first search
---
 * Opposite of DFS - uses queue 
 * Goes as wide as possible first (breadth)

Applications
---
 * Check if a node is connected to other nodes
 * Find cycles in the graph using DFS
 * Bipartiteness checks
	* Bipartite = can be colored with two colors
 * For K-COLOR, problem is NP-hard.
