# problems

A collection of algorithmic problems that I am doing as preparation for programming competitions, hackathons, interviews, and becoming a better programmer.

This repository is currently split into three folders:
* `comp` for competitive programming competitions 
* `leetcode` for problems from Leetcode
* `own` is just a sandbox for practice
