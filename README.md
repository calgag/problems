# problems

A collection of algorithmic problems that I am doing as preparation for programming competitions, hackathons, interviews, and becoming a better programmer.

This repository is currently split into three folders:
* Comp(etitive programming problems)
* Leetcode( problems)
* Own( problems made for practice by myself)
