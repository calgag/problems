# problems

A collection of algorithmic problems that I am doing as a hobby and preparation for programming competitions and technical interviews.

This repository is currently split into three folders:
* `comp` for competitive programming competitions 
* `leetcode` for problems from Leetcode
* `own` is just a sandbox for practice
